# Untitled Game

This repository contains no code as I eventaully plan to release a game with the engine being built. Releasing the engine code
now could potentially affect which platforms it could release on. So far I am the only contributor, but I have plans to add others,
with a some already ready to join in the project.
The old code that was present within the repositiory was deleted as it does not reflect the current build or structure of the project
in any way. A private repository is being used instead.
